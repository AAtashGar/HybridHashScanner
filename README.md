# HybridHashScanner

HybridHashScanner is a powerful command-line tool designed for security researchers to analyze file hashes against multiple threat intelligence platforms, including MISP, CIRCL Hashlookup, OTX, Kaspersky, and VirusTotal. It offers flexible input options, caching for performance, multithreaded processing, and optional Tor support for anonymity.

## Features

- Analyze single hashes or process directories of CSV/TXT files
- Supports MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and SHA512 hash types
- Integrates with MISP, CIRCL Hashlookup, OTX, Kaspersky, and VirusTotal
- Caches results in an SQLite database to optimize repeated queries
- Multithreaded workers for OTX and VirusTotal with rate limit handling
- Optional Tor integration for anonymous VirusTotal lookups
- Multiple modes: normal, quick, and extra with user prompts
- Outputs results in JSON and displays summaries in the terminal

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Required to run the script.
- **Tor**: Optional, for anonymous VirusTotal queries.

### Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

```
pip install pymisp requests tabulate pyfiglet colorama stem
```

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/AAtashGar/HybridHashScanner.git
  cd HybridHashScanner
  ```
  
2. Install the dependencies as shown above.
3. (Optional) Install Tor and ensure itâ€™s accessible in your PATH or specify its path in `config.json`.

## Usage

Run the tool with:

```
python HybridHashScanner.py [options]
```

### Command-Line Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-directory <path>` | Path to a directory containing hash files (CSV or TXT) |
| `-file_type <type>` | Type of files to process: `csv` or `txt` (required with `-directory`) |
| `-hash <hash>` | Single hash to analyze directly |
| `-output <file>` | Output JSON file path (default: `results.json`) |
| `-v, --verbose` | Enable verbose output for detailed logging |
| `-service <name>` | Service to query: `misp`, `hashlookup`, `otx`, `kaspersky`, `virustotal`, or `all` (default: `all`) |
| `--view <hash>` | View cached results for a specific hash |
| `--vt_view <hash>` | View only VirusTotal cached results for a specific hash |
| `--vt_confirm` | Confirm found hashes in VirusTotal (used with normal/extra modes) |
| `-q, --quick` | Quick mode: sequential checks with VirusTotal confirmation via Tor |
| `-e, --extra` | Extra mode: multi-phase checks with user prompts |
| `-tor` | Use Tor for VirusTotal requests in Quick mode (optional) |

### Examples

1. **Analyze a Single Hash:**
  
  ```
  python HybridHashScanner.py -hash 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
  ```
  
  Checks the hash against all configured services and saves results to `results.json`.
  
2. **Process a Directory of CSV Files:**
  
  ```
  python HybridHashScanner.py -directory ./hashes -file_type csv
  ```
  
  Processes all CSV files in the `hashes` directory.
  
3. **Quick Mode with TXT Files and Tor:**
  
  ```
  python HybridHashScanner.py -directory ./hashes -file_type txt -q -tor
  ```
  
  Sequentially checks hashes and confirms findings in VirusTotal via Tor.
  
4. **View Cached Results:**
  
  ```
  python HybridHashScanner.py --view 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
  ```
  
  Displays cached results for the specified hash.
  

## Configuration

Before running the tool, you must create and configure the `config.json` file in the project directory. This file should contain the necessary API keys and settings for the services you wish to use. Here is an example structure:

```json
{
    "misp_url": "https://your-misp-instance.com",
    "misp_key": "your_misp_api_key",
    "otx_key": "your_otx_api_key",
    "vt_keys": ["your_vt_api_key1", "your_vt_api_key2"],
    "kaspersky_key": "your_kaspersky_api_key",
    "cache_db": "cache.db",
    "tor_path": "/path/to/tor"
}
```

- **MISP**: Provide the URL and API key.
- **OTX**: Provide the API key.
- **VirusTotal**: Provide one or more API keys (comma-separated).
- **Kaspersky**: Provide the API key for OpenTIP.
- **Cache DB**: Path to the SQLite cache database (default: `cache.db`).
- **Tor Path**: Optional path to the Tor executable.

If a service is not configured (i.e., its key is missing or empty), the tool will display a notification and skip that service during execution.
